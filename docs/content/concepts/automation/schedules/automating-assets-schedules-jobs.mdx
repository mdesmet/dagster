# Automating assets using schedules and jobs

After creating some [asset definitions](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets), you may want to automate their materialization.

In this guide, we'll show you one method of accomplishing this by using schedules and jobs. To do this for ops, refer to the [Automating ops using schedules guide](/concepts/automation/schedules/automating-ops-schedules-jobs).

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to:

- Create a job that materializes assets
- Create a schedule
- Add the new job and schedule to your project's <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object
- Turn the schedule on

---

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you'll need:

- **To install Dagster and the Dagster UI.** Refer to the [Installation guide](/getting-started/install) for more info and instructions.
- **Familiarity with**:
  - [Asset definitions](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets)
  - [Jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs)
  - [Code locations](/concepts/code-locations) (<PyObject object="Definitions" />)

---

## Step 1: Create a job

The first step in creating a schedule is to build a job that materializes some assets.

Let's assume we already have a few assets in our project in a group named `ecommerce_assets`:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py startafter=start_assets endbefore=end_assets
@asset(group_name="ecommerce_assets")
def orders_asset():
    return 1


@asset(group_name="ecommerce_assets")
def users_asset():
    return 2
```

To create a job that materializes the assets in this group, we'll use <PyObject object="define_asset_job" />:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py startafter=start_job endbefore=end_job
ecommerce_job = define_asset_job(
    "ecommerce_job", AssetSelection.groups("ecommerce_assets")
)
```

To create the job, we:

1. Imported <PyObject object="AssetSelection" /> and <PyObject object="define_asset_job" />
2. Constructed the job using <PyObject object="define_asset_job" /> and name it `ecommerce_job`
3. Selected all assets in the `ecommerce_assets` group using <PyObject object="AssetSelection" />. Only these assets will be materialized when the job runs.

Refer to the [Asset jobs documentation](/concepts/assets/asset-jobs) for more info and examples.

---

## Step 2: Define the schedule

Next, we'll construct the schedule using <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" /> and attach it to the job we created in [Step 1](#step-1-create-a-job).

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py startafter=start_schedule endbefore=end_schedule
ecommerce_schedule = ScheduleDefinition(
    job=ecommerce_job,
    cron_schedule="15 5 * * 1-5",
    default_status=DefaultScheduleStatus.RUNNING,
)
```

To build the schedule, we:

1. Imported `DefaultScheduleStatus` and <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" /> from `dagster`
2. Created a schedule using <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" /> that:

   - Is attached to the `ecommerce_job` job
   - Has a cron expression of `15 5 * * 1-5`, which translates to `Every Monday through Friday of every month at 5:15AM`
   - Is turned on by default (`default_status`). We'll discuss this more in [Step 4](#step-4-turn-the-schedule-on).

---

## Step 3: Update the Definitions object

Next, we'll update our project's <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object to include the new job and schedule. This ensures the job and schedule are available to Dagster processes, such as the Dagster UI.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py startafter=start_definitions endbefore=end_definitions
defs = Definitions(
    assets=[orders_asset, users_asset],
    jobs=[ecommerce_job],
    schedules=[ecommerce_schedule],
)
```

At this point, your code should look like the following:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py lines=3-12,14-23,27-30,35-40,45-49
from dagster import (
    AssetSelection,
    DefaultScheduleStatus,
    Definitions,
    ScheduleDefinition,
    asset,
    define_asset_job,
)


@asset(group_name="ecommerce_assets")
def orders_asset():
    return 1


@asset(group_name="ecommerce_assets")
def users_asset():
    return 2


ecommerce_job = define_asset_job(
    "ecommerce_job", AssetSelection.groups("ecommerce_assets")
)

ecommerce_schedule = ScheduleDefinition(
    job=ecommerce_job,
    cron_schedule="15 5 * * 1-5",
    default_status=DefaultScheduleStatus.RUNNING,
)

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[orders_asset, users_asset],
    jobs=[ecommerce_job],
    schedules=[ecommerce_schedule],
)
```

---

## Step 4: Turn the schedule on

Schedules must be turned on before they can be used. In our case, we already turned the schedule on by using the `default_status` parameter in its <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" />, but there are a few other ways to do this:

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Dagster UI">

<Note>
  <strong>Heads up!</strong> Starting or stopping a schedule in the UI will
  override any default status set in code.
</Note>

To turn on a schedule in the Dagster UI, navigate to **Overview > Schedules**:

<!-- ![Schedules tab in the Dagster UI](/images/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules/schedules-tab-toggle.png) -->

<Image
alt="Schedules tab in the Dagster UI"
src="/images/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules/schedules-tab-toggle.png"
width={1920}
height={512}
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="CLI">

To start and stop schedules via the [dagster CLI](/\_apidocs/cli#dagster-schedule), use the following commands:

```shell
dagster schedule start
dagster schedule stop
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Python code">

<Note>
  <strong>Heads up!</strong> Starting or stopping a schedule in the UI will
  override any default status set in code.
</Note>

You can set the schedule's default status using `DefaultScheduleStatus.RUNNING` in the schedule's <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" />:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py startafter=start_schedule endbefore=end_schedule
ecommerce_schedule = ScheduleDefinition(
    job=ecommerce_job,
    cron_schedule="15 5 * * 1-5",
    default_status=DefaultScheduleStatus.RUNNING,
)
```

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

After the schedule is started, it will begin executing immediately if the [dagster-daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon) process is running. This process starts automatically when `dagster dev` is run.

<!-- TODO: Refer to the [Troubleshooting schedules](/concepts/automation/schedules/troubleshooting) guide if the schedule has been started but isn't submitting runs. -->

<!-- TODO: ## What's next?

That's it! At this point, you should have a working, running schedule in your Dagster project. From here, you can:

- Check out the [Schedule examples](/concepts/automation/schedules/examples) for ideas and inspiration
- Create [tests for your schedules](/concepts/automation/schedules/testing) to make sure things are running smoothly
- Refer to the [Automating pipelines guide](/guides/dagster/automating-pipelines) for more pipeline automation ideas
