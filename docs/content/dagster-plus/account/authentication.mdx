# Dagster+ authentication and user management

In this guide, we'll cover Dagster+'s supported authentication methods and some resources for managing users in your organization.

---

## Authentication methods

### Single Sign-on

Dagster+ supports Single Sign-on (SSO) with the following providers:

- **Google**. Users must be [added in Dagster+](/dagster-plus/account/managing-users#adding-users) before they'll be able to log in using their Google accounts.
- GitHub

### SAML

To provide administrators with more control, Dagster+ also supports SAML authentication with the following Identity Providers (IdP):

  <ArticleListItem
    href="/dagster-plus/account/authentication/setting-up-pingone-saml-sso"
    title="PingOne"
  ></ArticleListItem>
</ArticleList>

**Note**: Users must be assigned to the Dagster app in the IdP to be able to log in to Dagster+. Refer to the setup guide for your IdP for more info.

### SCIM provisioning

The [System for Cross-domain Identity Management specification](https://scim.cloud/) (SCIM) is a standard designed to manage user identity information. When enabled in Dagster+ alongside SSO, SCIM allows you to efficiently and easily manage users in your IdP and sync their information to Dagster+.

## User management and role-based access control

Role-based access control (RBAC) enables you to grant specific permissions to users in your organization, ensuring that Dagster users have access to what they require in Dagster+, and no more.

    title="Managing user roles and permissions"
  ></ArticleListItem>
  <ArticleListItem

  ></ArticleListItem>
  <ArticleListItem
    href="/dagster-plus/account/managing-users"
    title="Managing users"
  ></ArticleListItem>
</ArticleList>

See [Dagster+ deployment settings reference](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/deployment-settings-reference#sso-default-role) for how to configure the default role which is granted to new users that log in with SSO.
